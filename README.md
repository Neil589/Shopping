# Shopping
A price watching application that allows customers to monitor sales at different stores to get the best deal possible.
Primarily uses the observer design pattern to monitor changes. 
A game/simulation can also be run where the user is given $100 which they can use to spend at stores which periodically put up sales ti simulate the shopping experience.
Made with Java for Comp 301.
